Select the text and tweet the selected text to Twitter/X

== Description ==

Select and Tweet is a simple yet powerful WordPress Plugin which provides ability to the site visitors to share any content from a website to the twitter by simply selecting the text. You can choose from our pre designed templates for showing the tweet sharing button.

Also not to forget, as a site owner you can also pre highlight the text so that users can share the pre highlighted text directly to the twitter even without needing to select. This way you are letting your users read the highlighted portion of the content too.
